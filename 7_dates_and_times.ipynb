    "Being able to handle dates and times, particularly for time series applications, is a critical part of data-cleaning. It is easy to let subtle bugs creep in due to parsing dates and times incorrectly or not accounting for timezones. On rare occasion, you may encounter datasets coming from a system that bravely uses custom time types, like 27-hour clocks (yes, this happened to me!).
