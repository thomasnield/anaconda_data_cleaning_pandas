This could reveal larger issues that are dirtying your data but are not detectable just by looking at the dataset alone. The data could be biased, or missing relevant data or variables for the problem being solved. If you have data that is full empty values (which we will discuss techniques for removing), you should fully understand why they are empty and whether there is a deeper problem in the process producing the data. For example, if a broken temperature sensor is recording `NA` or `NaN` values at a specific weather station, you should address fixing that sensor rather than just removing those records entirely. If a station is producing duplicate records, the software bug should be fixed rather than removing the duplicates.\n",
